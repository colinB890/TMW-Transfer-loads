PROBLEM: A trucking company which specializes in fluid hauling is having difficulty in tracking transfer loads. These are loads which are not taken from a storage facility directly to a job.

The nature of these jobs is to spray calcium on various roads within 3 distinct provinces in Western Canada. (BC/Alberta/Saskatchewan)

Outside carriers are employed by this company in order to transfer to spray units.

Those who manage inventory are wanting to track which transfer loads went to each unit, and drivers are often negligent in performing a ?handshake? when they accept these loads, making accounting for these events near impossible. Once a transfer load is shipped, it could go onto any one of the trucks, or to any job in the area, and there are many. 

What needs to be done is to take a load where the transfer is the delivery point, and pair it with a spray job where the transfer is the loading point, and match each unique TMW.

What was proposed was very time consuming, as management had suggested hand scrolling through the TMW generated data manually in order to perform this action, thereby consuming much time where it could have been better utilized.

I wrote this as a dispatcher who entered the business late in the game, and wanted to improve upon the situation to make things more efficient.

My proposal here was to pair each load shipped as a transfer with a load received as a transfer based on common features, such as weight, volume, product, market, and of course a shared date.

The date feature was somewhat difficult, since a load could have been shipped at the end of May, for instance, and received early June, so I create a ?Shared Date? from the existing data, where the end date of the shipped load became common with the started date of the received load.

One pairing feature I had hoped to incorporate into this for future loads was to insert into the comment section of the original data (Through manual entry) was what we called a ?Master Order? or an abbreviation of each account, which would ensure each load was paired to the correct customer account, even if it could not be paired with the actual spray unit which did the job. Unfortunately, I was unable to employ this method. 

If further developed, I do believe this principle would be useful for a trucking company to utilize in order to track missing loads based on certain freight dimensions and timeframes.

This is a basic model which can be tailored to fit other company needs in terms of their unique products.

RESULT: The end result of this project, as it stands, is an excel spreadsheet with each TMW paired according to the model, as well as remainder numbers which did not find a match. Some weights and volumes are at 0, since driver tablets had a tendency to error out, and this was not sent through the TotalMail server. These entries would have to be entered manually.

An eventual front end could be added to this project in order to make a program which someone in inventory could utilize themselves, in order to filter the dates, and jobs themselves.

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The original data was proprietary, and contained driver names. I eliminated these features in order to keep the data anonymous.
